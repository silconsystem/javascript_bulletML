This project is taken from another Japanese site, http://shinh.skr.jp/jsdmkun/jsdmkun.html
Its Kenta Cho's BulletML ported to Canvas, written in Javascript. I have made it work locally, the folders should be named
as in these files, if yo study the code a bit you'll soon find all the PATH variables to make it work for you.
I intend to use it for more canvas TouHOu Doujin games and learning purposes. I'd like to make a game in Java or C++ so I
can do more music and graphics without resticions and learning BulletML will enable me to make many great patterns
for sure !! Great stuff from mr.Kenta Cho, he has a couple of games in the GNU/Linux software centers too !!

This program only works from a HTTP server so dont run index.html from file
XML files are loaded from file, for fast parsing load them as variable

uncomment initlog() line 385 and check the box below the stop button to view the bulletML log, this slows down the parser so use it for debug only
The original author is unknown, but whoever you are:
Thank you, I'll try to make good use of it...
