This project is taken from another Japanese site, http://shinh.skr.jp/jsdmkun/jsdmkun.html
Its Kenta Cho's BulletML ported to Canvas, written in Javascript. I have made it work locally, the folders should be named
as in these files, if yo study the code a bit you'll soon find all the PATH variables to make it work for you.
I intend to use it for more canvas TouHOu Doujin games and learning purposes. I'd like to make a game in Java or C++ so I
can do more music and graphics without resticions and learning BulletML will enable me to make many great patterns
for sure !! Great stuff from mr.Kenta Cho, he has a couple of games in the GNU/Linux software centers too !!
